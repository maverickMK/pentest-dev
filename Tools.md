ssh with x11 with windows
Don't use XMING, uninstall it and use VcXsrv
Xming has not been updated since 2007, the newer versions of Xming are behind a paywall and the 2007 version you're using is super old and does not work well (in 2007, Windows Vista was the latest). VcXsrv is continually updated and free.
then just start VcXsrv (select Multiple windows and display number -1) and run the following command ONCE in bash:
echo "export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0" >> ~/.bashrc
